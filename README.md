# gold_price_prediction using Artificial Neural Networks

**Objective:**
The primary goal was to develop a robust predictive model capable of forecasting gold prices with precision. By harnessing the potential of ANN, coupled with meticulous feature engineering and model tuning, the objective was to create a reliable tool for investors and analysts seeking informed decisions in the volatile gold market.

**Methodology:**
Commencing with data preprocessing, the journey began with standard scaling to normalize the features, ensuring uniformity and enhancing model performance. Subsequently, Support Vector Machine (SVM), a powerful algorithm for regression tasks, was employed to capture intricate patterns within the data. TensorFlow, the cutting-edge framework for building deep learning models, served as the backbone for constructing the neural network architecture.

**Results:**
The outcome was remarkable, providing a predictive model that exhibited both robustness and accuracy. Through meticulous experimentation and fine-tuning of hyperparameters, the ANN showcased its prowess in capturing subtle nuances in gold price dynamics. With a perplexity that demystified market fluctuations and a bustline that empowered stakeholders with actionable insights, the model emerged as a beacon of foresight in the realm of financial forecasting.
